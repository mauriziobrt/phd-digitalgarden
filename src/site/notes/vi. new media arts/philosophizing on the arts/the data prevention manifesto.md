The Data Prevention Manifesto

http://amsterdam.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-1611/msg00028.html

The privacy discourse sputtered out of steam. This has lead to the current stalemate: we know we're observed, traced and tracked, but pretend it's not happening or nothing to fret about. The question is not when the repressed will return but how? Hackers have been proclaiming that privacy has been dead for decades, that everything can and will be captured, stored and analyzed. And they were right. So, what's to be done?

Or are we about to fall asleep and be numbed forever, having
accepted that everything we do, think and desire, can and will be
stored, and can be used against us?

Our credo is: do not feed the platforms.

Data prevention is a direct response to top-down 'smart' city
technologies. We aim to uphold a preventive-strike. The 'smart'
discourse is only trying to cover up the fact that these are spying
technologies.
