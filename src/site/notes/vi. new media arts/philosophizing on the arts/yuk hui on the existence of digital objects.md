In order to focus his attention on the digital object Hui attempts an almost Husserlian bracketing, epoché, of all other aspects of technics.  In other words, in the interest of a particular philosophical impetus he proposes to limit the book to a narrow investigation of the digital object alone.  What is a digital object?  He explains, “By digital objects, I mean objects that take shape on a screen or hide in the back end of a computer program, composed of data and metadata regulated by structures or schemas” (Hui, 2016:1).

Just like Schaeffer's sound objects, in order to objectify something, we have to remove it from its context.

_Ontology in the context of the internet is often associated with the inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, and his term “semantic web,” a set of standards for data formats and exchange protocols._

_The internet as a public realm that the engineering class takes for granted has all but disappeared, leaving no space to implement experimentation on the fundamental (indeed ontological) level. This raises the question of whether ontological adventures such as this one can be successful without a political angle._
