In order to focus his attention on the digital object Hui attempts an almost Husserlian bracketing, epoché, of all other aspects of technics.  In other words, in the interest of a particular philosophical impetus he proposes to limit the book to a narrow investigation of the digital object alone.  What is a digital object?  He explains, “By digital objects, I mean objects that take shape on a screen or hide in the back end of a computer program, composed of data and metadata regulated by structures or schemas” (Hui, 2016:1).

Just like Schaeffer's sound objects, in order to objectify something, we have to remove it from its context.
