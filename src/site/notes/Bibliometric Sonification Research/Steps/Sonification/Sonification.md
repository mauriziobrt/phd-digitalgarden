# Experiment 1:

Relation between total number of publications and number of peer reviewed publications.

**Approach a series of mapping and then choose the most meaningful.**

Mapping with frequency.

I can understand the mapping and how the ratio reduces.

Next step: map it using a perceptual scale

  

**Multimodal representation (not graphical) text+audio**

Name of university (visual display)+ number of connections with other universities (sound)

# Experiment 2:

**Sonification of cocitation networks**

Sonification of networks poses several problems, but it can be dealt by using adequate methodologies. It is important to focus on the relations between elements rather than on the object themselves.

I propose 2 different experiments for this type of sonification:

- Using Iannix we recreate the network, we give IDs to the different nodes and we filter the playback according to the nodes we want to hear. We can decide if we want only first degree relations or if we want also n degree relations. The system could work as a sort of feedback delay system. We could approach this with signal, and studying the number of feedback network system existing, with a mention to cybernetic systems. The playback could be made using Supercollider and OSC. The network in Iannix should be created interactively by using tabular data. It should be possible to change the mapping, like for example using umap as a morphing tool that changes our perspective on the relationships between these networked elements. (we map multidimensional data and then reduce it) (we could also get approaches from the gestural control of music)
- We start from the tabular data and we try to find pure sonic methods that donâ€™t rely on a graphical representation, but rather on the multidimensionality of the original data. The objective is to convey informations through sound that are not visually understandable through the graphic representation. So we have to think outside the graphic, consequently we ditch graphic.

  

**Example 1:**

The distance between two points could indicate the number of shared papers between the two universities, indicating closeness between the two.

  

  

**Possible artistic outcome:**

Phrase database that evolves according to our ongoing interaction with the sonification system, creating an ongoing composition that traces with a sort of memory our path.
