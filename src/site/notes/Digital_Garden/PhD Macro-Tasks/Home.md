# Non-verbal communication of invisible information: New methods for communicating complex and inaccessible information through sound[^1]

<div style="column-count: 2;">

The objective of this project is to establish novel methods that leverage sound as the primary communication modality to facilitate the communication of intricate and inaccessible information. The research team members´ diverse expertise in software technology, sound and music computing, affective computing, and electronic music composition will be combined to achieve this goal. We will develop software tools that can observe key software properties that are crucial for users, and sound models for effective mappings between the observed software and generated sound parameters. These mappings are crucial for utilizing sound to provide feedback about the complexity and vast amounts of information that are otherwise hard to grasp. The project consists of five work packages that are intertwined in a spiral approach, with three major development cycles spanning the project´s entire duration. The project will culminate in the creation of novel theories, guidelines, models, and tools for the sonic representation of software properties in interactive applications. This work is part of the growing research fields known as code analysis, data sonification, interactive sonification, multisensory perception, and non-verbal communication.
