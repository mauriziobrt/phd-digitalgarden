### Ordered thoughts:

Should I put in my study plan a course that can maybe help me learn the stuff that Benoit Baudry was supposed to help the project with?

Qual è il mio obiettivo? Attraverso questa ricerca trovare 1 pratiche di trattare dati interni al computer 2 comprenderne appieno la natura 3 riutilizzare per la creazione di opere artistiche che possono essere sia performative che installative e nello stile mi piacerebbe una roba verso vtol oppure alexander schubert, comunque verso ars electronica ecco. Cioè voglio nuovi metodi per la computer assisted composition, nuovi processi, magari ispirarsi a lavori di Mauro Lanza per portarli in musica, cioè gli algoritmi nella partitura, partitura come notazione della successione sistematica dei gesti e dello sviluppo dei materiali, sia da un punto di vista ritmico che timbrico o altro. Però ecco Musica relazionale come la chiama Lehman.

  

I think that the field of software studies contains lots of materials relevant for my research.

I also share the thought that was noted yesterday which is that a continuous stream sonification is not as useful as creating single events that signifies something clear. Reading and perceiving continuous stream is hard.

  

![image 3.png|image 3.png](/img/user/Assets/image%203.png)

Ah ma posso usare fourier per ridurre una serie temporale e ottenere un andamento più semplice, non ci avevo pensato. E linear regression obv per calcolare il prossimo stato.

aa weekly season vs annual season cioè se la varianza(?) è a livello settimanale o annuale, qui nell’anno più o meno sempre uguale ma invece ogni settimana varia un botto quindi capito

### Code ideas:

For the example of database lookup and sonification:

Pattern Recognition → I have a database of sequential data → I segment it → I reduce the segment to n points → I compare the segments to each other and group them according to similarities ? → I get some macro-groups → Iterate and automate

else → Find ways of making clustering algorithms fit into this description….

Ok but isn’t this just a classification algorithm… So maybe SED will be more ideal I think, but applied to data. How do we get the most recurrent patterns?

  

So i need to do some machine learning - so i may need some power on my computer. Do we have some google colab credits or anything of that sort?

Pervasive AI→ we need audio we can’t always rely on visual

The importance of having balanced datasets. At the dataset level we decide the outcome of the deep learning algorithm

He also talks about Source separation for isolating stuff I mean yeah in real life use cases it’s useful.

I mean NMF decomposition can be extremely useful

Meglio modellare con Fourier o moving average?

We need meta-representations, we cannot not take into account perception and most importantly attention / listening conducts while creating sonifications.

Recommendation Algorithms? We have the recommendation algo of twitter now

**Plan for meeting:**

1 - Go through the research plan

2 - Highlight the 3 waves of research that could go through this project in my opinion

3 - Show the trend in Making the invisible visible - in questo caso “making the invisible audible” - Comunque viene utilizzato in diversi contesti sia sociali che tecnologici, quindi si filtra molto. Exposing the invisible?

4 - How do I get grammarly premium?

  

  

### What is the invisible? How did this concept evolve from the past? Which invisible is the scope of our research? Are we interested in big data? (maybe it should be re-contextualized since the trend is old and many discussions have been made around it)

### How are our digital infrastructures structured? What is going on behind them that is also important to put our focus on? Do we need another research project on how computationally expensive are generative technologies? (answer: no we don’t, avoid this trend) We should look past the trend to get a real understanding of this issue. What is our purpose with this research? Is it social awareness or something else? Do we need to create debugging tools?

### OSINT is something that really interest me, should it be something a project on the software itself or on how the software process our data?

  

Cookies? Or code injections and displaying what happens at assembly level? (idk doesn’t seem prolific, like maybe creating meta objects no?)

**EVITA** le Yuval Noah Harari vibes - la tecnologia come soluzione ultima di tutti i problemi - cioè determinismo tecnologico etc…

Digital footprint! That’s something interesting for people, and that’s connected to OSINT.

  

  

> Quantified digital information, whether called ‘big data’ or not, is here to stay. As with all successful technologies, it recedes from our attention as it saturates and structures our everyday lives (Feenberg, 1999; Kitchin and Dodge, 2011). We must critically ask who it speaks for and why before it disappears from consideration. [https://www.societyandspace.org/articles/what-does-a-critical-data-studies-look-like-and-why-do-we-care](https://www.societyandspace.org/articles/what-does-a-critical-data-studies-look-like-and-why-do-we-care)

> A more common charge levelled against ‘big data’ is that it typically identifies mere correlations in datasets. Further, such large, diverse datasets may be biased. The difference between correlation and causation as well as the care that goes into identifying worthwhile datasets continue to hold validity in an era of ‘big data’ [https://www.societyandspace.org/articles/what-does-a-critical-data-studies-look-like-and-why-do-we-care](https://www.societyandspace.org/articles/what-does-a-critical-data-studies-look-like-and-why-do-we-care)

  

> ‘Big data’ is never “raw.” It has always been “baked” through both its construction and its resulting interpretation (Gitelman, 2013)

It is important to note that the listening conduct is also extremely relevant in Sonification. If I use passive listening I don’t understand what is going on, I have to switch to attentive listening.

So it would be cool to find patterns inside this tracer - To perceive these patterns though we have to isolate them in groups - Maybe we should magnify it and then go deeper into their perception, sort of like Stockhausen “Kontakte”.

  

Research Questions:

Which are the hidden processes of software? → Taxonomy? Catalogue?

Which methods can we use to highlight these processes?

Monitoring and metrics of software first come to mind. OpenTelemetry, WandB etc..

  

One thing could be, an interactive installation, where user can play with a website (like OpenTelemetry Demo) for a limited time. And then results of their interaction get sonified and visualized. This could raise awareness I think.

  

Another one could be also like you scroll for a certain amount of time and we try to get

  

Sonification should be more kin to language than music, since language is a human construct that evolved to convey informations and communicate.

How to find patterns in noise

Finding patterns in noise involves various methodologies that leverage signal processing techniques to enhance the detection and characterization of signals amidst noise.

One approach is the use of the Hilbert-Huang transform, which is an adaptive method for time series analysis. This technique allows for the decomposition of nonstationary signals with high time-frequency resolution, although it can be affected by noise. To improve its effectiveness in detecting signals with low signal-to-noise ratios, it can be complemented with techniques such as zero-phase filtering and kernel density estimation [2].

Another method involves the continuous wavelet transform, which has been applied to detect and localize spikes in noisy neural recordings. This unsupervised technique does not require template construction or threshold setting, making it robust across various recording conditions. Simulations indicate that this method outperforms traditional techniques, such as amplitude thresholding, in terms of accuracy and false positive rates [3].

In the context of speech detection, a novel approach utilizing multiband modulation energy tracking has been developed. This method focuses on analyzing the energy and spectral content of speech signals in noisy environments, employing short-time signal analysis tools. The technique demonstrates improved robustness against noise, achieving significant reductions in misclassification errors compared to classic algorithms [4].

Additionally, the detection of faults in induction motors under noisy conditions can be enhanced through the optimized Stockwell transform. This automated scheme analyzes starting currents to detect broken bar faults and assess their severity, achieving high accuracy even with minimal data and short acquisition times [5].

These methodologies illustrate the diverse strategies available for identifying patterns in noise, highlighting the importance of adaptive techniques and robust signal processing in various applications.

1. Pattern recognition in correlated and uncorrelated noise  
    Gold, Jason M, Conrey, Brianna. 2009.  
    Abstract: This study examined how correlated, or filtered, noise affected efficiency for recognizing two types of signal patterns, Gabor patches and three-dimensional objects. In general, compared with the ideal observer, human observers were most efficient at performing tasks in low-pass noise, followed by white noise; they were least efficient in high-pass noise. Simulations demonstrated that contrast-dependent internal noise was likely to have limited human performance in the high-pass conditions for both signal types. Classification images showed that observers were likely adopting different strategies in the presence of low-pass versus white noise. However, efficiencies were underpredicted by the linear classification images and asymmetries were present in the classification subimages, indicating the influence of nonlinear processes. Response consistency analyses indicated that lower contrast-dependent internal noise contributed somewhat to higher efficiencies in low-pass noise for Gabor patches but not objects. Taken together, the results of these experiments suggest a complex interaction among signals, external noise spectra, and internal noise in determining efficiency in correlated and uncorrelated noise.

2. Methods for detection and characterization of signals in noisy data with the Hilbert-Huang transform  
    Gagarin, Nicolas, Stroeer, Alexander, Cannizzo, John K., Camp, Jordan B.. 2009.  
    Abstract: The Hilbert-Huang transform is a novel, adaptive approach to time series analysis that does not make assumptions about the data form. Its adaptive, local character allows the decomposition of nonstationary signals with high time-frequency resolution but also renders it susceptible to degradation from noise. We show that complementing the Hilbert-Huang transform with techniques such as zero-phase filtering, kernel density estimation and Fourier analysis allows it to be used effectively to detect and characterize signals with low signal-to-noise ratios.

3. Spike detection using the continuous wavelet transform  
    Burdick, Joel W, Nenadic, Zoran. 2005.  
    Abstract: This paper combines wavelet transforms with basic detection theory to develop a new unsupervised method for robustly detecting and localizing spikes in noisy neural recordings. The method does not require the construction of templates, or the supervised setting of thresholds. We present extensive Monte Carlo simulations, based on actual extracellular recordings, to show that this technique surpasses other commonly used methods in a wide variety of recording conditions. We further demonstrate that falsely detected spikes corresponding to our method resemble actual spikes more than the false positives of other techniques such as amplitude thresholding. Moreover, the simplicity of the method allows for nearly real-time execution.

4. Multiband Modulation Energy Tracking for Noisy Speech Detection  
    EVANGELOPOULOS, Georgios, MARAGOS, Petros. 2006.  
    Abstract: The ability to accurately locate the boundaries of speech activity is an important attribute of any modern speech recognition, processing, or transmission system. The effort in this paper is the development of efficient, sophisticated features for speech detection in noisy environments, using ideas and techniques from recent advances in speech modeling and analysis, like presence of modulations in speech formants, energy separation and multiband filtering. First we present a method, conceptually based on a classic speech-silence discrimination procedure, that uses some newly developed, short-time signal analysis tools and provide for it a detection theoretic motivation. The new energy and spectral content representations are derived through filtering the signal in various frequency bands, estimating the Teager-Kaiser energy for each and demodulating the most active one in order to derive the signal's dominant AM-FM components. This modulation approach demonstrated an improved robustness in noise over the classic algorithm, reaching an average error reduction of 33.5% under 5-30-dB noise. Second, by incorporating alternative modulation energy features in voice activity detection, improvement in overall misclassification error of a high hit rate detector reached 7.5% and 9.5% on different benchmarks

5. Broken Bar Faults Detection Under Induction Motor Starting Conditions Using the Optimized Stockwell Transform and Adaptive Time-Frequency Filter  
    Doaa Khalil Ibrahim, Mohamed Esam El-Dine Atta, Gilany, Mahmoud I. 2021.  
    Abstract: Most of the published research studies for detecting induction motor broken bar faults (BBFs) use a time-frequency <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">(t\,\,-\,\,f) </tex-math></inline-formula> decomposition tool to characterize the fault-related components. However, the identification and the assessment of these components in <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">(t\,\,-\,\,f) </tex-math></inline-formula> domain require skilled user or powerful pattern recognition technique. Moreover, a relatively long starting duration is necessary. This article introduces an automated scheme to detect BBFs and distinguish fault severity in induction motors under startup conditions regardless of the user experience and even under short starting duration and in a noisy environment. This scheme is based on the analysis of the starting current using optimized Stockwell transform (ST). An active-set algorithm is applied to maximize the energy concentration of the left-side harmonic (LSH) component. Then, an adaptive time-frequency filter is applied to extract the LSH component from the <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">(t\,\,-\,\,f) </tex-math></inline-formula> domain, where the energy of the right part of LSH (RLSH) is utilized as an effective index for BBFs detection and for discriminating BBFs severity. Both real experimental data and simulation-based tests on 0.746- and 11-kW motors are used to extensively verify the performance of the proposed scheme. The achieved results have ensured that the proposed scheme can achieve a high accuracy with the minimum data and shortest acquisition time in comparison with some recent methods in the literature.
